## Description

This is a CLI application that performs server-side rendering through Handlebars.

## Installation

* Please run `npm install` to install the dependancies (express, handlebars and mysql) before you execute this application.

## Usage 

Execute the application by giving the following command on the command line:
`$node server.js`

* The application shows a screen to enter burger names. 
- As each burger is entered, it also shows a `Devour It` button next to it.
- When the `Devour it` button is clicked, the burger moves off the list of burgers to the list of devoured burgers.
- Each burger information is saved in the burgers table.

My Task list for developing this application are as follows:

[x] Building the application

[x] Running Tests 

[ ] Fully functional

[ ] User testing

[ ] User feedback 


## Credits

I have made extensive use of handlebars website to check usage and syntax of commands. I sought help from my tutor to understand and approach this homework.
